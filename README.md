## About The Project

![Travel Site screenshot](./screenshot.jpg)

The project aims to create a travel website with three sections: Our Beginning, Features, and Testimonials. It also features a Get In Touch modal and a Secret Client Area form which was built using a [serverless function](https://www.netlify.com/blog/intro-to-serverless-functions/) to restrict the access to the content only to users who have the secret phrase.
